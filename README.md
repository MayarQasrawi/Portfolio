# 💼 Frontend Portfolio – Mayar Qasarwa

This project is part of the **HTML & CSS Task**, where I was asked to design and implement my own personal portfolio website.
The main goal of this portfolio is to present myself as a web developer by showcasing my projects, technical skills, and providing an easy way to get in touch with me.

## 🎨 Figma Wireframe Design

Before development, I created a basic wireframe using Figma, based on best practices and clean layout principles.

## 📚 What is a Portfolio?

A developer portfolio is a personal website with the sole purpose of **selling yourself as a developer**.
It highlights your **projects**, **skills**, and includes a **contact section** to allow others (recruiters, collaborators, etc.) to reach out.

## 🔍 Research & Approach

* I began by researching the **importance of portfolios** and comparing them to alternatives like LinkedIn and GitHub.
* I reviewed several **inspirational portfolios** (without copying designs), such as:

  * [Ramma Heshwari](https://www.rammaheshwari.com/)
  * [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)
  * [Matt Farley](https://mattfarley.ca/)
* My goal was to build a **simple, clean, accessible, and fully responsive** layout following modern best practices.

## ✏️ Design & Implementation Highlights

* Used **semantic HTML5 tags** to improve structure, accessibility, and SEO.
* Applied **CSS custom properties (variables)** for theme colors and easier maintenance.
* Integrated **Scroll Spy** for active link highlighting as users scroll.
* Implemented a working contact form using [**W3Form**](https://w3forms.com/) – no backend needed.
* Focused on a **mobile-first** and **responsive layout** using media queries and flexible units.
