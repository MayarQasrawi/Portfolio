# 💼 Frontend Portfolio – Mayar Qasarwa

This project is part of the **HTML & CSS Task**, where I was asked to design and implement my own personal portfolio website.  
The main goal of this portfolio is to present myself as a web developer by showcasing my projects, technical skills, and providing an easy way to get in touch with me.

## 📚 What is a Portfolio?

A developer portfolio is a personal website with the sole purpose of **selling yourself as a developer**.  
It highlights your **projects**, **skills**, and includes a **contact section** to allow others (recruiters, collaborators, etc.) to reach out.

---

## 🔍 Research & Approach

- I began the project by researching **why portfolios are important** and exploring **alternatives**, such as LinkedIn profiles and GitHub repositories.
- I reviewed some **inspirational portfolios** for layout and content ideas (without copying designs), like:
  - [Ramma Heshwari](https://www.rammaheshwari.com/)
  - [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)
  - [Matt Farley](https://mattfarley.ca/)
- I focused on building a **simple, clean, and responsive** layout as recommended.

## ✏️ Design 

I used the [Figma Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTFaQWZBqQ8) to create a basic wireframe design before starting development.
